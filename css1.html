    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media. </li><br>
        <li><span class="listelt">Css is not necessary</span><span class="elt2">CSS saves alot of work.</span><span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span></li><br>
        <li class="elt3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</li></c2>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="spacing">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.However, <span class="elt2">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <P>When comparimg CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</P>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors avaialable. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
